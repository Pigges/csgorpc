# CSGORPC

Get enhanced Discord playing status for CSGO.

To install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run:

```bash
npm start
```

In order to get it to work, you will need to put the `gamestate_integration_rpc.cfg` file (or similar) in your cfg folder found where you have CSGO installed.
It is found relative to the Steam folder at `Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/cfg`.
